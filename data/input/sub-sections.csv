ensure that effective CDMSs are developed, enhanced and maintained.
While these components are specifically aimed at larger organizations with a substantial
investment in information and communication technology, smaller organizations can also
benefit from investment in the types of issues discussed.
These components are also relevant to broader initiatives, such as when an aid or development
agency sponsors CDMS development and implementation.
These issues will only be discussed very briefly, as each component refers to a substantial
body of knowledge that will require ongoing investment from specialists to ensure effective
management of resources and funds for information and communication technology.",
4.1.1,Climate observations,"This subsection refers to the system’s capacity to handle climate observation variables. The list
below is not comprehensive and additional variables may be required or recommended.
The list is currently based on the ECVs published in 2010 by GCOS. However, it is worth noting
that there are other types of variables that are very relevant to climate observation, such as
visibility, evaporation and meteorological phenomena.
Observations include measurements made by observers, traditional sensors and remote
sensors.
For more information, see:
• GCOS website
• GCOS web page on ECVS",
4.2.1,Climate database,"This subsection refers to the database(s) used to store and manage a range of time-series data,
including: climate observations, climate metadata (observations, discovery and data provenance),
spatial information, derived data and related data required for effective data management.
More advanced CDMSs may manage the data in a series of related databases rather than in a
single database.
It is recommended that the climate database provide support for the following functionalities,
classified by priority:
Required
• Managing core observations described in the Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100).
• Managing observation metadata (such as station metadata) and integrating them with
observations data.
• Handling observations from multiple sensors per station, per phenomenon, and recording
the source of each observation.
• Managing multiple tiers of data quality, from raw records to homogenized data.
• Managing spatial and time-series data.
Recommended
• Covering at least the GCOS ECVs.
• Using a robust data model that takes into account the requirements of open spatial
standards, particularly the ISO 19156:2011 Geographic information – Observations and
measurements standard, METCE and the WMO climate observations application schema (see
component 4.2.3.2).
• Managing metadata related to data provenance. This entails ensuring that each change to
an observation is recorded for future recovery, and recording the details of why a particular
change was made, which includes:
– Tracing the product lineage to the data source. For example, what observations and
gridded data were used to underpin the analysis released in peer-reviewed paper X?
– Ensuring that the reason for each observation change is recorded.
• Managing third-party and crowdsourced data.
• Managing intellectual property rights related to data.
• Enabling point-in-time recovery. For example, what data were present in the database for
station X at time T?
• Storing a range of document formats, such as:
– Photographs of observation stations and instruments, meteorological phenomena, etc.
– Scanned paper observation forms
– Scanned microfiche/microfilm
– Relevant observations metadata documents, such as instrument calibration reports
– Technical manuals
– Site location plans and sections
– Videos and other multimedia formats
Optional
• Handling data uncertainty (for more information, see Wikipedia articles on uncertain data
and uncertainty).
• Managing multidimensional time-series gridded data and possibly numerical models.
• Providing support for the information management concepts of semantics and linked data.",
4.2.2,Foundation standards,,
4.2.3,WMO logical data models,,
4.3.1,Observations metadata,"This subsection covers access to and management of station metadata and platform metadata.
Station and platform metadata are time-series data that describe how, when and where
meteorological observations were made and the conditions they were made under. They are
used to support a range of activities that allow climate professionals to understand the fitness
for purpose of specific data and, in many cases, improve the quality of climate observations
data. This type of metadata is referred to as observations metadata in this publication.
It is anticipated that application schemas (also known as logical data models) will be developed
to formally define the structure and content of the information required to describe climate
observing stations, sensors and platforms (see the Climate observations application schema
component (4.2.3.2))
Note: As a general rule, it will be necessary to record and maintain the details of any change to
observations metadata in order to understand the context surrounding specific climate data and
to support future data homogenization activities. In addition to details of the change, specific
reference must be made to:
• The date/time of the change.
Note: It may not always be possible to define the exact date of the change, for example when
a change happens between two site visits. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to include a
period of time during which the change occurred.
• The reason the change was made.
• The beginning and end dates of the prior value.
• Any date/time reference will need to be constrained by the appropriate temporal datum to
ensure that date handling is consistently applied.

4.3.2,Dataset discovery metadata,"This subsection refers to the processes, software and governance arrangements that ensure
that discovery metadata are captured, managed and maintained.
Discovery metadata are intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment of a spatial dataset
to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that may be at odds with the reason for which it
was originally created.
Discovery metadata may also be known as WIS metadata. They are not the same as the
observations metadata described above.
Note that some of the components below may be in addition to the WMO Core Profile of the ISO
19115 Geographic information – Metadata standard. This is not expected to be an issue as the
WMO Core Profile does not restrict the use of additional ISO 19115 records.
For more information, see:
• Discussion paper on stations metadata and the WMO Core Profile (Bannerman, 2012)
• WMO Core Metadata Profile version 1.3, Part 1 Conformance requirements
• WMO Core Metadata Profile version 1.3, Part 2 Abstract test suite, data dictionary and code lists
• Tandy (2010) also provides a useful introduction to discovery metadata. However, note that
the specifications part of this text has been superseded.
• ISO 19115 Geographic information – Metadata",
4.3.3,Data provenance,"This subsection refers to the processes, data and governance arrangements that record and
manage information relevant to climate data and enable end-users, including data managers,
scientists and the general public, to develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.
Data provenance allows an end-user to understand the history of each piece of data, and thus
helps the user to identify what version of the data was available at any given time.
The need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number
of attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate
incident and subsequent inquiries.
Therefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and
processes and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that
can be used for global climate studies.
While the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information
management domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the
concept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly
with regard to the development of the PROV standard.
The W3C defines provenance as:
[A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,
influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information
is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In
an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often
contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
(W3C, 2013a)
While this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate
domain.
The concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further
work to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in
Chapter 11.
Maintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite
expensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality
climate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what
data should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could
perhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.

• PROV data model specification (W3C, 2013a)",
4.4.1,Observation data products,"This subsection outlines the types of data products that NMHSs have committed to generate and
provide to WMO.",
4.4.2,Climate change indices,"This subsection represents the recommendations of the Commission for Climatology in the
elaboration of climate change indices. The Commission for Climatology/Climate Variability and
Predictability (CCl/CLIVAR) Working Group on Climate Change Detection has been coordinating
an international effort to develop, calculate and analyse a suite of indices so that individuals,
countries and regions can calculate the indices in exactly the same way such that their analyses
will fit seamlessly into the global picture.
Those indices have been split in two categories: core indices and approved indices.
For more information, see the website of the Joint CCl/CLIVAR/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate
Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI).",
4.5.1,Derived observation data,"This subsection describes a range of derived observational data products generated from
climate observation variables.",
4.5.2,Gridded spatial distribution of observations,"This subsection concerns the capacity to generate or manipulate gridded data according to
different techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation.
Some of these techniques are described in the Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100),
section 5.9 Estimating data.
These gridded data are spatial data. They are included in this section to show their lineage as a
type of derived climate data.",
4.5.3,Numerical models,"Note: The infrastructure, software and skills required to operate numerical models are
undoubtedly beyond the reach of many NMHSs.
As the output from numerical models is of interest to most NMHSs, it is expected that such
output will be available via a number of sources, including Regional Climate Centres.
Therefore, the CDMS should ideally have the ability to work with such data.",
4.6.1,Spatial,"This subsection represents a wide range of spatial information typically used to provide context
to climate data or as an input for spatial analysis processes. These data may be presented in
vector, image, gridded or multidimensional array data formats.
Typically, spatial representations of data contain aspatial attributes that describe various
properties of spatial features. The spatial and aspatial attributes of the data can be used to
support a variety of spatial analysis processes.
The components listed below are indicative of the types of spatial data that could be relevant to
climate. This list is not exhaustive.
See also:
• Statement of guidance for climate, Attachment 1 Requirements for climate data (Wright,
2012b)",
4.6.2,Climate documentation,,
4.6.3,Climate software,"As discussed in the article by the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee (2011), one
of the recommendations of the UK parliamentary review of the Climategate issue was to ensure
that climate scientists make available the full methodological workings (including computer
codes) used to support their work. An extract is reproduced below.
It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code
in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality
of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should
take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full
methodological workings (including the computer codes).
This has implications for the effective management of climate data and software in that software
source code will also require careful management.
In addition, it will be necessary to keep track of the time period during which each software
version is in operation, as this may also have implications for climate data and climate analysis.
On a conceptual level, this is similar in a way to the need to have effective observations metadata
that describe the maintenance of sensors and stations.",
5.1.1,Data ingest,,
5.1.2,Data extraction,,
5.2.1,Imaging,,
5.2.2,Monitoring,,
5.2.3,Data entry,"This subsection covers the functionality required to enable an appropriately trained and
authorized person to manually enter data into the climate database.
Typically, this functionality is tightly controlled according to NMHS data governance processes.
Some issues to consider are:
• Data entry staff should only be able to add data to or edit data in the climate database under
programme control, with appropriate safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the
climate database.
• Any functionality that provides write access to the database should also include an audit
function to allow an independent review of database changes.
– One example could be the use of database triggers that write the details of a transaction,
including the previous values, into a separate set of audit tables.
• Another approach could be to ensure that the data entry process creates an interim data
file that is then entered into the database via data ingest processes, bypassing the need for
direct access to the database.
• NMHS data policy may enforce the need for double entry practices, where two or more
operators key in data for the same form, independent of each other, to detect and minimize
key-in errors.
• Careful consideration should be made to ensure that an organization has very effective
IT security and monitoring in place prior to allowing key-in access via the Internet. Most
organizations will not have suitable controls in place. Therefore, key-in via the Internet should
be avoided as a general rule.
• NMHS data policy should provide guidelines as to appropriate data quality considerations
applied to data that are manually entered.",

5.4.1,Observations quality assessment,"This subsection refers to the processes implemented to help NMHSs assess the quality of
observations used by their organization. It covers all stages, from the observation site and
expertise level of personnel to the final product distributed to users.
The aim of this subsection is to move towards a more objective way of defining the quality of
observations data.",
5.4.2,Derived-data quality assessment,,
5.4.3,Quality assurance metrics,,
5.4.4,Uncertainty,"This subsection refers to the processes, software, governance processes and data analysis used
to understand and record the uncertainty inherent in the data.
As noted in the OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic Information – Observations and
measurements (p. 13), all observations have an element of uncertainty:
The observation error typically has a systematic component, which is similar for all estimates
made using the same procedure, and a random component, associated with the particular
application instance of the observation procedure. If potential errors in a property value are
important in the context of a data analysis or processing application, then the details of the act
of observation which provided the estimate of the value are required.
This functionality will support:
• Future statistical analysis that takes into account the uncertainty inherent in data.
• Communication of data uncertainty.
For more information, see Wikipedia articles on:
• Uncertain data
• Uncertainty",
5.5.1,Manage climate metadata,"This subsection refers to the processes, software, governance mechanisms and data analysis
required to effectively manage climate metadata, which include metadata on observations,
discovery and data provenance.
Note: This subsection is deliberately kept generic in this version of the CDMS Specifications,
with all types of climate metadata bundled together. While the Create and Maintain components
(5.5.1.1 and 5.5.1.2, respectively) are classified as recommended, in reality data provenance
metadata has not yet been adequately defined. Therefore, a pragmatic approach would rightly
not address the creation and maintenance of data provenance metadata until this has been
rectified. The creation and maintenance of discovery and observations metadata, however, is
required.
For more information on climate metadata, see section 4.3 of this publication.",

8.1.1,Open Geospatial Consortium services,,
8.1.2,Geography Markup Language application schema,"Application schemas (as defined in ISO 19109:2005 Geographic information – Rules for
application schema) provide an abstract representation of the content and structure of
information resources. The Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)
outlines the use of application schemas specifically developed for the climate domain.
These abstract representations of information provide the basis for deriving concrete encodings
or data formats that allow the information to be serialized for exchange between systems and
organizations.
Work is proceeding within WMO to harmonize existing TDCFs (FM 92 GRIB Edition 2 and FM
94 BUFR Edition 4) with WMO METCE (described in the METCE component (4.2.3.1)), with the
intent to bind those existing data formats to explicit, well-understood semantics.
In addition, the application schema can be used to develop XML-based data encodings using
widely supported open standards for geographic information. The ISO 19136:2007 Geographic
information – Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides rules for serializing the
abstract data model expressed as an application schema via XML encoding to create a GML
application schema.
In summary:
• An application schema can be thought of as a logical data model. For more information, see
the subsection on WMO logical data models (4.2.3).
• A GML application schema is a physical model that is derived from a logical data model
published using a particular technology – which in this case is GML. For an example, see the
Combined climate observations and metadata component (8.1.2.1) below.
Deriving a GML application schema from an application schema developed specifically for
the climate domain (see Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)) is
anticipated to make climate data far more readily consumable for a broader community of users
such as those interested in determining the impacts of climate change.
While work has been conducted for several years, this task is still in its early stages as at
December 2013. It is expected to take a number of years to complete.
For an overview of how a logical data model (and associated application schema) could be used
with climate data, see Bannerman (2012), pp. 20–26.
For a more detailed description of what has been done to date, see Tandy (2013a), which provides
an overview of the direction that WMO logical data model work is taking with regard to METCE.",
