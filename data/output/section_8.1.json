    "title": "Open spatial standards",
    "text": "This section has been included because open spatial standards are seen as a mechanism that is\nbeing increasingly adopted by many organizations and industry sectors around the world. These\ntypes of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives\nsuch as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The\nWMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.\nOpen spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf\nsoftware, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data\nthat are served via such services.\nThis is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not\nroutinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take\nthe data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate\ndata can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing,\ntourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand\nWMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered\nin such formats.\nWhile developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage\nof external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own\ninternal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.\nIn short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism\nfor distributing data in future years.\nNote: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards\nand services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These\ncomponents are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards\nthat are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this\npublication.\nFor more information, see:\n\u0095 The Climate Challenge Integration Plugfest 2009 executive summary video, which describes\nthe results of a global collaborative project demonstrating how climate data could be used\nvia open spatial standards.\n\u0095 The Open-source Geospatial Foundation overview of OGC standards (see OSGeo Live).\n\u0095 The Geonovum wiki, which provides an overview of open spatial standards. This wiki is an\ninitiative of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure executive committee in the Netherlands.\n\u0095 The OGC Abstract Specifications, which provide a more detailed theoretical overview of the\ntheory and rationale underpinning open spatial standards.\n\u0095 The ISO/Technical Committee 211 Advisory Group on Outreach Standards Guide: ISO/TC 211\nGeographic Information/Geomatics."
