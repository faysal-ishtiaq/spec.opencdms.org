    "text": "In order to share climate data between organizations or make meaningful comparisons between\ninformation from datasets provided by different publishers, it is highly recommended that\nclimate data conform to a logical data model.\nA logical data model describes the content and structure of information resources at an\nabstract level. When implemented in a CDMS, the logical data model underpins the design of\nthe information objects managed by the system and helps to determine the questions that one\nmay ask of the system when querying those information objects and their interrelationships.\nFurthermore, the logical data model may be used as the basis for developing data formats\nwithin which the information objects can be serialized for exchange between systems \u0096 thus\nensuring interoperability between those systems.\nWMO is currently developing a logical data model termed the Mod\u00e8le pour l\u0092 \u00c9change des\ninformations sur le Temps, le Climat et l\u0092Eau2 (METCE), which is intended to provide a basis for\napplication-specific data models, including those used for climate observing and climate data\nmanagement.\nIdeally, the underlying database structure will be based on the logical data model."
