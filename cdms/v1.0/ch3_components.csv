3.1.1.1,WMO resolutions,"This component refers to the policy framework
within WMO, governed at the highest level
through Congress and the Executive Council.
The list of current resolutions can be found in
Resolutions of Congress and the Executive Council
(WMO-No. 508).
Some resolutions have major implications for
data policy, such as Resolution 40 (Cg-XII), which
provides guidelines for the policy and practice of
exchanging meteorological data, and Resolution
25 (Cg-XIII), which provides guidelines on the
exchange of hydrological data.
The major innovation in these resolutions is
the definition of essential data. Through these
resolutions, WMO Members commit to making
essential data available on a free and unrestricted
basis at no more than the reasonable cost of
extraction and formatting for delivery to the user.
Members may not impose additional charges for
essential data.",Required
3.1.1.2,WMO Technical Regulations,"This component covers standard practices and
procedures, as well as recommended practices
and procedures, for WMO Members to follow and
implement.

or best practices that are generally drawn up
as guides published by the different technical
commissions:
• Commission for Basic Systems
• Commission for Instruments and Methods of
Observation
• Commission for Hydrology
• Commission for Atmospheric Sciences
• Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology
• Commission for Agricultural Meteorology
• Commission for Climatology
• Joint WMO/IOC Technical Commission for
Oceanography and Marine Meteorology
(JCOMM)
While most of the guides are relevant to CDMSs, it
is recommended that particular attention be paid
to:
• Guide to Meteorological Instruments and
Methods of Observation (WMO-No. 8), from the
Commission for Instruments and Methods of
Observation
• Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No.
100), from the Commission for Climatology",Required
3.1.1.4,International,"This component concerns commitments that
organizations are required to adhere to because
they qualify as international agreements.
Some examples are:
• The Global Framework for Climate Services,
which has an important role in climate
data management, climate monitoring and
assessment, climate products and services,
and climate information for adaptation and risk
management.
• International data policy agreements, such
as the Infrastructure for Spatial Information
in Europe, which has defined and legislated
common principles for European Union
countries that enable the sharing of
environmental spatial information among
public-sector organizations. This generally
includes climatological data.
• The Group on Earth Observations (GEO), which
concerns the exchange of observations data.
• The OGC and ISO, which focus on the exchange
of data via open spatial standards. Note that
not all standards are relevant.",Required
3.1.1.5,National,"This component represents national policies that
organizations are required to comply with. Some
examples are:
• National government policies on open data and
open-source software.
• National spatial data infrastructure frameworks
that govern the exchange of national spatial
data.",Required
3.1.2.1,Disaster recovery,"This component refers to a policy that governs
how an organization implements disaster recovery
and business continuity solutions and covers
issues such as how to handle data backups. Some
initial issues to consider are:
• How important is the climate record?
• How often should climate data be backed up?
While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide
some background information, this question must
be answered by each NMHS. Their answer will
need to take the following into account:
– How important are their data?
– How much data can they afford to lose?
– How much work can they afford to redo?
– In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing
their requirements, it is suggested that daily
backups be made with weekly off-site storage.
• How many redundant copies of the data should
be kept?
• What secure off-site facility should be used to
store disaster recovery versions of the data?
• What is the acceptable downtime for each of
the key CDMS applications?
• How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to
the organization’s infrastructure due to a range
of factors, including:
– Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush
fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?
– Man-made disturbances, such as military
conflict, terrorism and fires?
Where should the secure off-site storage be
located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their
infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be
appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in
another city or country.
Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to
store and manage climate data and offer CDMS
services to end-users?",Required
3.1.2.2,Funding,"This component concerns a policy that regulates
how an organization funds its CDMS to ensure that
it is sustainable. This includes sufficient funding
for:
• Climate data management specialists, including
staff with knowledge of observations data, data
rescue, quality assurance, etc.
• IT specialists who support the everyday
maintenance of CDMS applications and related
databases and IT equipment.
• IT specialists who conduct enhancements to
the CDMS and related IT environments.
• The provision and scheduled upgrade of IT
systems to ensure that the appropriate IT
environment has been implemented to support
the CDMS.",Required
3.1.2.3,Data custodian,"This component represents a policy that governs
how an organization manages and maintains its
climate data.
A data custodian is typically a senior-level
manager who is accountable for the integrity of
the climate record of the NMHS.
Some examples of a data custodian’s duties are:
• Preserving the integrity of the climate record,
including quality control and ensuring that
observational networks provide data that are
suitable for climate purposes.
• Championing the cause of data management to
ensure that sufficient funding is allocated and
managed effectively so that the climate record
remains viable.
• Facilitating the development and maintenance
of suitable policies governing climate data.
• Ensuring that climate data are effectively
managed and maintained.
• Ensuring that observations metadata, discovery
metadata and data provenance are effectively
maintained.
• Formally delegating authority to appropriate
staff members, together with related
performance accountabilities.
• Taking primary responsibility for CDMS
applications, CDMS enhancement and IT
maintenance projects.
• Ensuring that IT changes do not corrupt the
climate record.
• Implementing and monitoring relevant key
performance indicators to help monitor
ongoing performance of the CDMS and related
processes.",Required
3.1.2.4,Access to data,"This component involves a policy that governs
how an organization allows access to data.
Some issues to consider are:
- How is read-and-write access to climate data
controlled?
- What training is needed before staff are
granted write access?
- What types of controls are needed to monitor
and approve changes to the climate record
to facilitate data maintenance and error
rectification?
- How are any specific access constraints,
such as security, contractual or commercial
constraints, to be managed?
Note: The issue of open data is increasing in
relevance for many national governments that
have made open-data commitments. Therefore,
organizations should have a clear understanding
of, and a clear policy for, the provision of NMHS
climate data in accordance with open data
principles (see Wikipedia article on open data).
In summary, open data is about ensuring that
data are freely available for reuse with no
constraints apart from perhaps the requirement
to acknowledge the data source and ensure that
the data are made available under a share-alike
agreement.",Required
3.1.2.5,Archival policy,"This component represents a policy that dictates
how organizations archive their climate data,
including both digital and hard-copy historical
records.
This archive should be considered as permanent
to ensure that the climate record is available for
use by future generations.
Therefore, care should be taken to ensure that the
data are preserved in a format that users will be
able to access and use in years to come.",Required
3.1.3.1,Data licensing,"This component refers to policies that ensure that
any data licensing agreements that relate to the
use of a dataset are clearly understood.
For example:
• What data licences apply to NMHS data?
• What data licences will the NMHS release its
data under? For example:
– Is a Creative Commons licence appropriate?
(See Creative Commons website)
• What data licences used by external dataproviders
are permitted for use within the
NMHS?
• Can the data be distributed to third parties?
• Will the NMHS use and/or archive data that are
not covered by an appropriate data licence?
• Will the NMHS comply with the licensing of
data passed to it, or will it choose not to use or
archive the data?",Required
3.1.3.2,Access constraints,"This component concerns policies that clearly
define any access constraints relating to the use of
climate data.
For example:
• What may the NMHS do with the data?
• Can the data be used for the organization’s
website, web services, publications and so
forth?
• Do any commercial or contractual constraints
apply to the use of the data?
• Are the data subject to any national security
constraints?",Recommended
3.1.3.3,Usage constraints,"This component covers policies that ensure
that any constraints imposed on the enduser
regarding the use of a dataset are clearly
understood. These constraints may apply to the
NMHS or to third parties.
For example:
• Can the data be freely reused?
• Is there a cost that applies to the use of the
data? See the Commercial component (3.1.5.3)
for a number of related considerations.
• Can derived products be made using the data?
• Can the data be used for commercial purposes?
• Can the data be used for private, study or
research purposes?
• Can the data be shared with others?
The Creative Commons website provides
examples of data usage constraints and related
licences.",Recommended
3.1.3.4,Copyright,"This component refers to policies that clearly
explain any copyright issues relating to the use of
climate data.",Recommended
3.1.3.5,Attribution,"This component deals with policies that ensure
that any data attribution issues relating to the use
of climate data are clearly understood.
For example:
• Should the source of the data be
acknowledged?
• How does the NMHS ensure that any attribution
text required by the data provider is applied
when the data are used?",Recommended
3.1.4.1,Interoperability standards,"This component involves policies that ensure that
climate data are delivered using appropriate open
interoperability standards, such as open spatial
standards.
This will ensure that data are available in a
form that facilitates data interoperability and
are accessible to a wide range of end-users
from disparate industries using a wide variety
of proprietary and open-source software
applications.
Note: It is possible to enforce the use of data
formats such as BUFR or GRIB within an NMHS
in an attempt to facilitate interoperability. In
reality though, only NMHSs and closely related
organizations will be able to understand the
formats and have the software to use the data.
For more information, see section 8.1 of this
publication.",Recommended
3.1.4.2,Quality of delivered data,"This component refers to policies that clearly
define the issues relating to the quality of the
climate data delivered by NMHSs.
For example:
• What quality of climate data does the
organization undertake to deliver and in what
circumstances?
• Will the organization only provide high-quality
homogenized data?
• Will the organization provide raw observations?
• When is it appropriate to deliver data at each
quality level?",Required
3.1.4.3,Cost recovery,"This component refers to policies that ensure
that issues relating to the recovery of costs for
the provision of NMHS climate data services are
clearly understood and communicated.
These policies should also take into account:
• NMHS commitments to WMO relating to
Resolutions 25 (Cg-XIII) and 40 (Cg-XII), as
discussed above.
• National commitments to open data policies.",Recommended
3.1.5.1,Crowdsourced,"This component refers to policies that address and
explain issues relating to the use of crowdsourced
climate data by the NMHS (see Wikipedia article
on crowdsourcing).
In summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining
data from a large pool of volunteers who would
like to collaborate with the organization.
Crowdsourcing has considerable potential for
enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that
the data are used appropriately. There are many
examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have
generated very useful data. Some examples are:
• OpenStreetMap
• Old Weather – a data rescue project to digitize
meteorological observations from old ship logs
• Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met
Office (United Kingdom)
• Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France
Some issues that crowdsourcing policies should
consider are:
• Only accepting crowdsourced data when the
supplier has agreed to either provide the data
under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see
Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its
intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.
• Having intellectual property rights to the data
recorded for future use.
• When the data contributed are observations data:
– Having the contributor commit to providing
and maintaining suitable observations
metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).
– Having the contributor agree to appropriate
site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality
assurance processes.
• Deciding when it is appropriate to use
crowdsourced data and under what conditions.
• Deciding how the crowdsourced data will be
managed.",Recommended
3.1.5.2,Other agency,"This component refers to policies that provide
clear explanations of issues regarding the use of
climate-related data captured and maintained by
government agencies external to the NMHS.
Examples of issues to consider include:
• Is there a clear data licence allowing the NMHS
to use the data for any relevant purpose,
including for internal use, to create derived
products, to publish the data on the NMHS
website or for data redistribution, if required?
• Are there any costs associated with the use of
the data?
• Is it a high-quality dataset? Do the discovery
metadata clearly describe the intended use,
lineage and quality assessment of the data?
• What constraints apply to the use of the data?
• If the data are observations data, are there
high-quality metadata available to support
CDMS activities?
• If the data are of similar quality to NMHS data,
share similar functions and help enhance the
NMHS data, is the provider willing to consider
joint ownership and maintenance of the data?",Recommended
3.1.5.3,Commercial,"This component refers to policies that address and
clarify issues on the use of climate-related data captured
and maintained by commercial organizations.
In addition to the considerations discussed under
the Other agency component (3.1.5.2), other issues
that commercial policies should consider include:
• What contractual arrangements apply to the
use of the data?
• What costs apply explicitly to the use of the data?
• Are there constraints on the number of users
who can access the data at the same time?
• Are there pricing qualifications based on the
specific server environment that hosts the data,
or more specifically on:
– The number of central processing units,
processor cores, threads and so forth?
– Whether there are any restrictions based on
the virtualization of the server?
• Is there a time limit for the use of the data? If
so, what must be done with the data at the end
of this period?
• Are the data only available via a subscription
service or web service? If so, what impact will
this have on NMHS operations in the event of a
disruption of the service or when an invoice is
not paid on time?
• Are there any explicit commercial constraints
on the use of the data?
• Are the data actively maintained?
• Do the costs, constraints and associated risks
call for an arrangement to be made between
the NMHS and the data provider?
• Are there alternative datasets of similar
functionality and quality that could be obtained
elsewhere, such as a community-maintained
dataset like OpenStreetMap?",Recommended
3.1.6.1,Climate metadata,"This component refers to polices that ensure that
appropriate climate metadata are maintained to
facilitate a better understanding of climate data.
As defined in section 4.3, climate metadata include
metadata on observations, discovery and data
provenance.",Required
3.1.6.2,Data lineage traceability,"This component concerns policies that ensure that
the CDMS is able to trace the lineage of climate
data from published scientific texts and other
papers back to raw observations.
This will include the ability to reproduce specific
data that were held in the climate database at a
particular point in time. Note that it may not be
practical to implement this policy retrospectively,
i.e. for papers published in the past.
This specific policy requirement has become
increasingly relevant following the so-called
Climategate issue. One of the conclusions of the
UK parliamentary enquiry that investigated this
issue was that:
> It is not standard practice in climate science
> to publish the raw data and the computer
> code in academic papers. However, climate
> science is a matter of great importance
> and the quality of the science should be
> irreproachable. We therefore consider that
> climate scientists should take steps to make
> available all the data that support their work
> (including raw data) and full methodological
> workings (including the computer codes).
> Had both been available, many of the
> problems at UEA [University of East Anglia]
> could have been avoided. (UK Parliament
> Science and Technology Committee, 2011)",Required
3.1.6.3,Data generation,"This component covers a range of policies that
govern the generation and interpretation of
observation variables.
As these rules have changed and may change
again in the future, the policies will need to cover
past, current and future data generation policies.
Some considerations are:
- These policies will need to cover the methods,
algorithms, models and software source code
used to generate data.
- They should include a definition of a
climatological day.
- They should also cover the rules relating to the
management of missing observations.
Some inconsistencies have been found in a number of
WMO guidelines. For example, conflicting approaches
regarding the handling of missing observations when
computing a daily or monthly average, and especially
regarding the handling of a number of consecutive
missing data, are presented in:
- Guide to Climatological Practices
(WMO-No. 100)
- Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30-Year
Standard Normals (WMO/TD-No. 341), WCDP-10
- Handbook on CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP
Reporting (WMO/TD-No. 1188)
Inconsistencies in WMO guides have also been noticed
regarding the generation and storage of observations
data recorded at minute frequency and the generation
of hourly observation data. For example, the definition
of climatological days may differ:
- Between NMHSs
- Between different stations within a single
NMHS
- Over time within the same NMHS
- Between a given NMHS policy and the method
applied by the software used in automatic
weather stations (which often appear as a black
box to NMHSs). For example, a climatological
day could represent the following time periods:
    - From 0000 LST to 2300 LST
    - From 0100 LST to 0000 LST the next day
    - From 2346 LST the previous day to 2345 LST the current day
    - From 0900 LST the previous day to 0900 LST the current day
There are also inconsistencies due to the use of
either local standard time or daylight saving time.
The same issues apply to the definition of a
climatological hour.",Required
3.1.6.4,Climate networks,"This component concerns a range of policies that
determine the design of climatological networks
and establish the station and network operations,
including observation times, on-site quality
control, observer training, station inspections, etc.
For more information, see:
• Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No.
100), section 2.5 The design of climatological
networks, and section 2.6 Station and network
operations
• Technical Regulations (WMO-No. 49), Volume I,
Part II, 1.3.1.1.2:
> The distribution of stations from which
> monthly surface climatological data are
> transmitted should be such that every
> 250 000 km2 is represented by at least
> one station and up to 10 stations where

> data are transmitted should be such that
> every 1 000 000 km2 is represented by at least
> one station.",Required
3.1.6.5,Sensor or station change,"This component covers a range of policies that
apply to changes affecting a station or sensor
(such as a replacement or relocation). These
policies are of great importance for time-series
analysis. They have implications for climate
metadata and for the possible implementation of
parallel observations for certain time periods.
For more information, see:
• Manual on the Global Observing System
(WMO-No. 544), Volume I, Part III, 3.2.4:
> At reference climatological stations, any
> change in instrumentation should be such as
> not to decrease the degree of accuracy of any
> observations as compared with the earlier
> observations, and any such change should
> be preceded by an adequate overlap (at least
> two years) with the earlier instrumentation.
• Guide to Meteorological Instruments and
Methods of Observation (WMO-No. 8), Part II,
1.1.4 Climatological requirements:

• Guidelines on Climate Metadata and
Homogenization (WMO/TD-No. 1186),
WCDMP-53",Required
3.1.6.6,Quality assurance,"This component refers to policies that ensure that
quality assurance issues within an organization
are clearly understood.
Some issues to consider are:
• What level of quality assurance can the
organization afford to maintain over the long
term?
• Will the organization conduct quality assurance
checks on all observation phenomena or only
on a subset?
• What quality assurance levels (or tiers) are
used by the organization for the long term?
• How is each quality assurance tier defined?
• What quality assurance tests must data
successfully pass before they are promoted to
the next tier?
• How could the ISO 9000 series of quality
management standards help improve data
management processes?
See:
• Technical Regulations (WMO-No. 49), Volume IV",Recommended
3.1.6.7,Future Climate Data Framework,"This component refers to policies that may be
established by the future Climate Data Framework,
as discussed in section 11.1.
This may include, for example:
• Common and consistent definitions of key
datasets to be maintained by the NMHS,
including common dataset names and service
names.
• A common definition of a climatological day,
hour and so forth.
• A consistent way of determining data
uncertainty.
• Common definitions of data quality.
• The establishment of a quality assessment
classification for derived data.
• Authoritative taxonomies and code lists.
• Common policies for handling missing data
when creating derived data.
• Common policies for deriving data when
input data have differing levels of quality. For
example, policies covering:
    - The calculation of monthly averages when daily data are at different levels of quality.
    - The generation of derived gridded datasets for a region where data for relevant stations are at different levels of quality.
• Common policies for all components discussed
within this data policy section (3.1).
• The application of best practices for data
homogenization techniques.",Recommended
3.2.1.1,Controlled access to data and systems,"This component refers to governance processes
that ensure a clear understanding of user access
to data and IT systems within an organization.
Some data-related issues to consider are:
• Which staff roles have read or read-and-write
access to each type of data?
• Which roles have read or read-and-write access
to each quality tier of data?
• What process is in place for designating staff to
each role?
• What process applies to ensure that access to
data is subject to approval by a delegate of the
data custodian?
• Should users who have write access to data
stored within a database only be able to change
data under software control?
• Should each successful change to observations
data be audited to ensure that the change, the
details of the operator who made the change
and the time of the change have all been
recorded?
Some system-related issues to consider are:
• What roles should be given to run-time users to
access data?
• Which roles have the ability to change
operational software or systems?
• What process applies to ensure that access to
systems and software applications is subject to
approval by a delegate of the data custodian?",Required
3.2.1.2,Approval process for new data types,"This component refers to governance processes
that ensure that issues relating to the approval of
new data types within an organization are clearly
understood.
Some issues to consider are:
• What needs to be considered prior to accepting
a new data type for long-term archival (such as
user requirements, scientific requirements or a
new statutory requirement)?
• What are the projected storage requirements
for the data?
• What is the appropriate format for storing the
data over the long term?
• Is there likely to be an application that can read
that format in 10 or 20 years?
• What skills are available to process and analyse
the data over the long term?
• Is suitable funding available to maintain the
data over the long term?",Required
3.2.1.3,Approval process to change data,"This component refers to governance processes
that clearly define the approval process required
to modify the data held within an organization’s
climate record.",Required
3.2.1.4,IT change approvals - no data corruption,"This component refers to governance processes
that ensure that any IT change does not result in
an unexpected change to, loss of or corruption of
the climate record.",Required
3.2.2.1,IT service management,"This component refers to an overarching
framework for IT service management used to
ensure effective, efficient and cost-effective
management of the delivery of business value
from IT services.
This framework is typically based on global best
practices.
It comprises a consistent framework within which
the remaining IT governance components can
operate in a tightly integrated manner.
For more information, see:
• Wikipedia overview of IT service management
• Information Technology Infrastructure Library
(ITIL) website
• ITIL publications",Recommended
3.2.2.2,Managed change,"This component covers governance processes that
ensure that any change to the CDMS is carefully
managed.
Uncontrolled change can result in chaos for users
of the CDMS, for example:
• Systems may break down for no known reason.
• Data corruptions or even data loss may occur
and may not be detected at all.
• Provenance of data is severely impacted, as
data managers do not know what algorithms or
processes have been applied to the data.
• Considerable disruption may be experienced
by staff that rely on the CDMS for day-to-day
activities and may inconvenience users who
rely on the data and derived products.
• Data corruption, data loss and lack of
availability of key systems may have a
significant impact on the reputation of the
NMHS.
Some issues to consider:
• How is the change process managed?
• Who needs to be consulted when considering a
potential change?
• How is the proposed change analysed to assess
its potential impact on data integrity and on
other CDMS components?
• Who can authorize a change?
• What testing is required to mitigate the
potential impacts of the change and give
confidence that the change is desirable?
• How can the change be made with minimal
impact?
• Are there any dependencies between a series
of proposed changes that may dictate that the
changes occur in a particular order?
• How is the change to be made and tested?
• If the change fails, how can the system be
rolled back to its previous state?
• How can CDMS components be implemented
such that they are self-testing to support
concepts such as continuous integration?
• Will processes based on an IT service
management framework such as ITIL help
improve the management of IT-related
changes? (See Wikipedia article on IT service
management)",Required
3.2.2.3,Project management,"This component concerns governance processes
that ensure that any development activity,
infrastructure change or other enhancement
related to the CDMS is carefully managed.
Good project managers and project governance
processes can mean the difference between a
project delivering desired results or the same
project failing at great expense, frustrating users
and possibly corrupting the climate record.
Uncontrolled enhancement can result in:
• An undesirable functionality added to the
CDMS.
• Lower-priority work undertaken at the expense
of higher-priority tasks.
• The development of activities that do not have
a clearly defined scope, set of deliverables,
timeline and budget.
Some additional considerations include:
• How is the business benefit for a proposed
project defined and assessed?
• How are the relative priorities of projects
assessed?
• How are projects managed? What approach is
adopted?
• What process is used to monitor the progress
of a project?
• How are the project deliverables assessed to
ensure that they meet requirements?
• What lessons can be learned from a finished
project?",Recommended
3.2.2.4,IT architecture,"This component refers to strategic IT governance
processes that ensure that CDMSs and related IT
systems are carefully designed so that the science
and NMHS requirements for CDMSs may be
effectively and efficiently implemented.
Uncontrolled development of components can
have adverse impacts on the CDMS, including on
the ability of the NMHS to maintain the CDMS over
the long term. For example:
• Reliance on proprietary solutions provided by a
single vendor could result in a situation known
as vendor lock-in. As time passes, more and
more components are developed based on
the single solution. It can be very difficult and
costly for a NMHS to move to a new CDMSrelated
solution if the current vendor’s product
becomes unaffordable or if the vendor goes
out of business, decides that it is no longer in
its interest to offer CDMS components, ceases
to maintain its systems or no longer offers a
competitive CDMS solution.
• Similarly, uncontrolled bespoke development
of CDMS components by NMHS staff or
contractors can also be a problem. This may
result in a wide variety of disparate CDMS
components that cannot be easily integrated.
Many different types of technology could be
used, resulting in high maintenance costs.
Key-person dependencies could also develop,
leaving the NMHS with a significant and costly
issue to resolve, particularly if the key person
leaves the organization and the CDMS ceases
to operate.
• CDMS component solutions could be
developed that do not effectively use NMHS
climate data, for example:
– Data may be replicated from the climate
database and made into stand-alone files to
support a particular technology or due to the
developer’s lack of experience. Whereas the
data in the climate database are subject to a
lengthy quality assurance lifecycle and may
change, the replicated data are fixed at a point
in time and may not be updated to reflect
later changes to the climate record. This may
become a significant issue for the NMHS,
particularly if this practice is systematically
applied by many developers, across many
applications and over many years.
– The data extraction process may not take
into account quality assurance flags and just
present raw observations with no indication
of data quality or reliability.
– Developers may not understand the
complexities of the climate database data
model and extract incorrect data.
– Components may have any number of data
inconsistency or misuse issues. What is the
impact on the reputation of the NMHS if the
same data are presented with differing values
by different CDMS components?
There may also be architectural considerations
that are better off understood early in the CDMS
development so that governance processes can
ensure that the considerations are implemented
within developed and/or implemented software.
One issue to consider is whether the CDMS
should be able to work in multiple languages.
The answer to this will have implications for the
design of software for the user interface of CDMS
components, as well as for the generation and
presentation of data products.
IT architecture is a specialized field of information
technology that is typically undertaken by highly
experienced professionals with very broad IT
experience. Ideally, this task will be conducted
by experienced NMHS staff to ensure that
consistent CDMS components are implemented in
accordance with a strategic vision.

3.2.2.5,Documentation,"This component covers governance processes that
ensure that the CDMS is adequately documented
and that this documentation is kept up to date
to facilitate efficient day-to-day use by staff and
ease the learning curve of new staff, contractors,
consultants, etc.
This documentation is very broad and includes:
• An overview of the CDMS
• An overview of the data being managed both
within and outside the climate database
• The CDMS components, design, business
requirements, architecture, test plans and
deployment processes
• CDMS policies and governance processes
• CDMS backup and disaster recovery processes
• IT systems management and administration
processes
• Various CDMS-related metrics",Required
