3.1.1.1,WMO resolutions,"This component refers to the policy framework
within WMO, governed at the highest level
through Congress and the Executive Council.
The list of current resolutions can be found in
Resolutions of Congress and the Executive Council
(WMO-No. 508).
Some resolutions have major implications for
data policy, such as Resolution 40 (Cg-XII), which
provides guidelines for the policy and practice of
exchanging meteorological data, and Resolution
25 (Cg-XIII), which provides guidelines on the
exchange of hydrological data.
The major innovation in these resolutions is
the definition of essential data. Through these
resolutions, WMO Members commit to making
essential data available on a free and unrestricted
basis at no more than the reasonable cost of
extraction and formatting for delivery to the user.
Members may not impose additional charges for
essential data.",Required
3.1.1.2,WMO Technical Regulations,"This component covers standard practices and
procedures, as well as recommended practices
and procedures, for WMO Members to follow and
implement.
The main references are the four volumes of the
WMO Technical Regulations (WMO-No. 49):
• Volume I – General Meteorological Standards
and Recommended Practices
• Volume II – Meteorological Service for
International Air Navigation
• Volume III – Hydrology
• Volume IV – Quality Management
Also see the publications of the annexes that are
part of the Technical Regulations:
• Annex I – International Cloud Atlas (WMO-No.
407), Volume I
• Annex II – Manual on Codes (WMO-No. 306),
Volumes I.1 and I.2
• Annex III – Manual on the Global Telecommunication
System (WMO-No. 386), Volume I
• Annex IV – Manual on the Global Dataprocessing
and Forecasting System (WMO-No.
485), Volume I
• Annex V – Manual on the Global Observing
System (WMO-No. 544), Volume I
• Annex VI – Manual on Marine Meteorological
Services (WMO-No. 558), Volume I
• Annex VII – Manual on the WMO Information
System (WMO-No. 1060)
• Annex VIII – Manual on the Implementation
of Education and Training Standards in
Meteorology and Hydrology (WMO-No. 1083),
Volume I",Required
3.1.1.3,WMO technical commission guides,"This component includes the recommendations
or best practices that are generally drawn up
as guides published by the different technical
commissions:
• Commission for Basic Systems
• Commission for Instruments and Methods of
Observation
• Commission for Hydrology
• Commission for Atmospheric Sciences
• Commission for Aeronautical Meteorology
• Commission for Agricultural Meteorology
• Commission for Climatology
• Joint WMO/IOC Technical Commission for
Oceanography and Marine Meteorology
(JCOMM)
While most of the guides are relevant to CDMSs, it
is recommended that particular attention be paid
to:
• Guide to Meteorological Instruments and
Methods of Observation (WMO-No. 8), from the
Commission for Instruments and Methods of
Observation
• Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No.
100), from the Commission for Climatology",Required
3.1.1.4,International,"This component concerns commitments that
organizations are required to adhere to because
they qualify as international agreements.
Some examples are:
• The Global Framework for Climate Services,
which has an important role in climate
data management, climate monitoring and
assessment, climate products and services,
and climate information for adaptation and risk
management.
• International data policy agreements, such
as the Infrastructure for Spatial Information
in Europe, which has defined and legislated
common principles for European Union
countries that enable the sharing of
environmental spatial information among
public-sector organizations. This generally
includes climatological data.
• The Group on Earth Observations (GEO), which
concerns the exchange of observations data.
• The OGC and ISO, which focus on the exchange
of data via open spatial standards. Note that
not all standards are relevant.",Required
3.1.1.5,National,"This component represents national policies that
organizations are required to comply with. Some
examples are:
• National government policies on open data and
open-source software.
• National spatial data infrastructure frameworks
that govern the exchange of national spatial
data.",Required
3.1.2.1,Disaster recovery,"This component refers to a policy that governs
how an organization implements disaster recovery
and business continuity solutions and covers
issues such as how to handle data backups. Some
initial issues to consider are:
• How important is the climate record?
• How often should climate data be backed up?
While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide
some background information, this question must
be answered by each NMHS. Their answer will
need to take the following into account:
– How important are their data?
– How much data can they afford to lose?
– How much work can they afford to redo?
– In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing
their requirements, it is suggested that daily
backups be made with weekly off-site storage.
• How many redundant copies of the data should
be kept?
• What secure off-site facility should be used to
store disaster recovery versions of the data?
• What is the acceptable downtime for each of
the key CDMS applications?
• How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to
the organization’s infrastructure due to a range
of factors, including:
– Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush
fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?
– Man-made disturbances, such as military
conflict, terrorism and fires?
Where should the secure off-site storage be
located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their
infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be
appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in
another city or country.
Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to
store and manage climate data and offer CDMS
services to end-users?",Required
