4.1,Observations data,
4.2,Logical data models,"In order to share climate data between organizations or make meaningful comparisons between
information from datasets provided by different publishers, it is highly recommended that
climate data conform to a logical data model.
A logical data model describes the content and structure of information resources at an
abstract level. When implemented in a CDMS, the logical data model underpins the design of
the information objects managed by the system and helps to determine the questions that one
may ask of the system when querying those information objects and their interrelationships.
Furthermore, the logical data model may be used as the basis for developing data formats
within which the information objects can be serialized for exchange between systems – thus
ensuring interoperability between those systems.
WMO is currently developing a logical data model termed the Modèle pour l’ Échange des
informations sur le Temps, le Climat et l’Eau2 (METCE), which is intended to provide a basis for
application-specific data models, including those used for climate observing and climate data
management.
Ideally, the underlying database structure will be based on the logical data model."
4.3,Climate metadata,"The term climate metadata is defined in this publication as the suite of supporting data required
to effectively manage climate data and assess the data’s fitness for purpose.
Climate metadata are made up of the following components:
Observations metadata Time-series data that describe how, when and where
meteorological observations were made and the conditions they
were made under.
Discovery metadata Information intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment
of a dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that
may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally
created.
Data provenance metadata Information relevant to climate data that allows end-users,
including data managers, scientists and the general public, to
develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.
The following section expands on each component of climate metadata."
4.4,WMO standard products,
4.5,Derived climate data,
4.6,Ancillary data,This section covers data required to support CDMSs.
5.1,Ingest and extract,"This section covers a very broad set of functionalities relating to the capture and initial
processing of observation and related data.
In essence, this section involves:
• Loading data into or extracting data from the climate database.
• Transforming data as required from one format into another more suitable for data
management, analysis and storage."
5.2,Data rescue,
5.3,Observations quality control,
5.4,Quality assessment,
5.5,Climate metadata,
6.1,Analysis,"This section describes a series of processes used to analyse climate data.
More work will be required to expand on this section in future revisions of this Specification."
7.1,Graphical user interface – time-series data exploration,
8.1,Open spatial standards,"This section has been included because open spatial standards are seen as a mechanism that is
being increasingly adopted by many organizations and industry sectors around the world. These
types of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives
such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The
WMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.
Open spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf
software, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data
that are served via such services.
This is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not
routinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take
the data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate
data can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing,
tourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand
WMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered
in such formats.
While developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage
of external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own
internal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.
In short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism
for distributing data in future years.
Note: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards
and services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These
components are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards
that are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this
publication.

the results of a global collaborative project demonstrating how climate data could be used
via open spatial standards.
