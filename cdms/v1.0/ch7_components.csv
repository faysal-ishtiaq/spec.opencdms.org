that review, validate and authorize content prior
to being published.",Recommended
7.1.3.1,Cartography,"This component represents the technology,
software, processes and governance processes
suitable for generating a wide variety of
cartographic output to effectively convey climate
data issues.
It includes:
• Spatial data preparation
• Cartography
• Simple point-and-click web maps",Recommended
7.1.3.2,3D,"This component provides the technology,
software, processes and governance mechanisms
suitable for visualizing and exploring climate data
and issues within a 3D environment.",Optional
7.1.3.3,Media viewer,"This component refers to the technology,
software, processes and governance processes
that enable various media to be displayed within
the graphical user interface. Some examples are:
• Photographs
• Diagrams
• Scanned documents such as scanned station
records

7.1.4.1,Spatial intelligence,"This component represents the technology,
software, processes and governance processes
that support an effective and dynamic analysis
of climate data within a web environment to
facilitate understanding of climate matters and
communicate issues relating to climate data. This
dynamic analysis includes:
• Geographical Information System (GIS)
functionality, including the ability to perform
spatial overlay analysis such as selecting points
in a polygon.
• The ability to search features by attribute, for
example:
– Conducting a search of all stations within the
catchment of a specific river.
– Filtering the resultant stations to view only
those that observe precipitation.
– Viewing summary observations data for each
of those stations.
This component integrates into a map-based
interface a wide range of time-series data
including climate observations, climate grids,
satellite imagery and topography, together with
appropriate textual and other attribute data, such
as climate metadata.
It also facilitates dynamic data exploration and
analysis using a broad array of integrated media,
including maps, charts, graphs, tables and written
reports.",Recommended
7.1.4.2,Integrated search of observations (metadata and data),"This component concerns the functionality that
allows an end-user to conduct an integrated
search of the climate database and the
observations metadata catalogue.
The search results will contain observations data
and observations metadata.
Some examples are:
• Determining what observations data are
available based on a set of parameters and
viewing the results in a table. These parameters
may include:
– Station
– Sensor or procedure
– Phenomena
– Data quality (based on quality flags, the
climate observation quality classification or
other method)
– Time period
– A variety of other observation metadata
parameters
• Reviewing observations metadata for selected
stations.
• Determining what datasets provide the actual
observations data for a given station, sensor
and phenomenon combination, together with
the URL of the relevant discovery metadata
records. The discovery metadata records will in
turn provide the URLs of any services providing
dynamic access to the data. An example could
involve searching for stations that use both a
tipping bucket raingauge and manual methods
to observe rainfall.
For more information, see:
• Section on climate metadata (4.3)
• Subsection on observations metadata (4.3.1)
• Observations metadata catalogue component
(8.2.1.2)
• Linked data component (8.2.2.1)",Required
7.1.4.3,Search discovery metadata,"This component refers to the functionality that
allows an end-user to search the CDMS discovery
metadata catalogue to:
• Determine what datasets are managed by the
NMHS. This search may be limited to datasets
that are available publicly or those that are only
available for internal use.
• Search for datasets in accordance with WIS
parameters, categories and keywords.
• Review discovery metadata records that
adequately describe a dataset to enable
searchers to determine whether it is suitable for
their particular use.
• Determine the URL that can be used to access
online services that host the dataset for
dynamic access and data download.
This same component could be used to search
WIS metadata catalogues.

• Section on climate metadata (4.3)
• Subsection on dataset discovery metadata
(4.3.2)
• Discovery metadata catalogue component
(8.2.1.1)
• Linked data component (8.2.2.1)",Recommended
7.1.4.4,Search data provenance metadata,"This component provides the functionality that
allows an end-user to search the CDMS data
provenance metadata catalogue to:
• Broadly determine the lineage of a dataset,
including the processes the dataset has been
subjected to.
• Trace the provenance of individual records in
detail, taking into account:
– What was changed?
– What was it derived from?
– When was it changed?
– What was done to change it?
– How and why was it changed?
– Who changed it?
– Who did they act on behalf of (if applicable)?
– Who authorized the change?

7.1.5.1,Data download,"This component represents the functionality
enabling end-users to download climate data.
This component is related to the climate data
delivery components (Chapter 8) and data
discovery registers.",Required
