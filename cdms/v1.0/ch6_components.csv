6.1.1.1,Numerical models,"This component represents the software,
processes and governance mechanisms that
provide numerical models such as general
circulation models (GCMs), also known as global
climate models.
A Wikipedia article defines general circulation
models as:
> [A] mathematical model of the general
> circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean
> and based on the Navier–Stokes equations
> on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic
> terms for various energy sources (radiation,
> latent heat). These equations are the basis
> for complex computer programs commonly
> used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean
> of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs
> (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of
> global climate models along with sea ice and
> land-surface components. GCMs and global
> climate models are widely applied for weather
> forecasting, understanding the climate, and
> projecting climate change.
Such climate numerical models could be global in
scale (like GCMs) but they could also be regional,
with generally a higher precision.
Downscaling techniques are often used when
creating regional models.
Models can be based on:
• The rules of physics, biology and chemistry
• Statistical rules
• A mix of dynamic and statistic methods
The use of climate models includes:
• Simulation of the present climate
• Simulation of the future climate
• Palaeoclimate reconstruction
• Seasonal forecasts
• Decadal prediction
Note: Most NMHSs would not have the resources
needed to effectively manage the infrastructure
and software required to support this component.
However, the data output from such components
may be useful and should be available for NMHSs
via a number of sources, including Regional
Climate Centres.

6.1.1.2,Reanalysis,"This component concerns the software, processes
and governance mechanisms that establish
“a meteorological data assimilation project
which aims to assimilate historical observational
data spanning an extended period, using a
single consistent assimilation (or “analysis”)
scheme throughout”. (See Wikipedia article on
meteorological reanalysis)",Optional
6.1.1.3,Model ensembles,"This component refers to the software, processes
and governance mechanisms used to aggregate
data from:
• A number of GCMs to produce products that
portray a range of model forecasts.
• A series of runs of the same model.",Optional
6.1.2.1,Spatial analysis,"This component represents the software,
processes and governance tools that handle a very
wide variety of raster and vector spatial analysis
techniques.
Some examples are:
• Generating grids that show the spatial
distribution of observations of a phenomenon
such as precipitation.
• Generating grids that represent the distribution
of the average maximum temperature for the
month of May for climatological standard
normals.
• Generating grids that represent the distribution
of the maximum temperature anomalies for
May 2010 when compared to the climatological
standard normal.
• Selecting all meteorological stations located
within a 10 km radius around a national
administrative boundary.",Recommended
6.1.2.2,Image analysis,"This component covers the software, processes
and governance tools that handle a very wide
range of image analysis techniques.
Some examples are:
• Processing remotely sensed satellite imagery
to measure the relative solar reflectance of
a satellite image, determine the cloud cover
within a scene or generate a normalized
difference vegetation index to measure
vegetation greenness.
• Processing ground-based radar imagery to
detect rain and storm activity.",Recommended
6.1.2.3,Time-series analysis,"This component concerns the software, processes
and governance mechanisms that analyse timeseries
data using a very broad range of analysis
techniques.
Some examples are the analysis required to
produce:
• WMO standard products such as extremes,
standard normals, World Weather Records and
climate change indices.
• A variety of derived observations data.

• Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No.
100), Chapter 4 Characterizing climate from
datasets, and Chapter 5 Statistical methods for
analysing datasets",Recommended
6.1.2.4,Teleconnection indices,"This component represents the software,
processes and governance processes used to
analyse, record and manage data representing
teleconnections and major climate indices such as
the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern
Oscillation Index.
According to an article on Wikipedia,
“[t]eleconnection in atmospheric science refers
to climate anomalies being related to each
other at large distances (typically thousands of
kilometers)”.",Optional
6.1.3.1,Data homogenization,"This component refers to the processes,
software, governance and analysis of highquality
observations data and metadata used to
develop high-quality homogenized time-series
datasets. Such datasets aim to ensure that the
only variability remaining in the time series is that
resulting from actual climate variability.
For more information, see:
• Guidelines on Climate Metadata and
Homogenization (WMO/TD-No. 1186),
WCDMP-53
• Trewin (2012) provides a good case study
• ETCCDI website

available on the data-rescue website of the
WMO Regional Association VI (RA VI) and CCl
Task Team on Data Rescue (TT-DARE)

homogenisation methods of climate series: an
integrated approach HOME (ACTION COSTES0601,
