4.2.1.1,Data dictionary,"This component represents the data dictionary,
which describes the database structure, data model
and other elements used by the climate database.",Required
4.2.2.1,Observations and measurements,"This component represents technology that
provides rules and a standardized approach for
modelling observations data, regardless of the
domain.
In essence, the ISO 19156:2011 Geographic
information – Observations and measurements
standard treats an observation as an event at a
given point in time whose result is an estimate of
the value of some property of a feature of interest,
obtained using a known observation procedure.
This standard is being widely adopted as the
framework for a number of logical data models
related to observations data, such as WaterML and
the Meteorological Information Exchange Model
of the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO).
It also underpins current work on the WMO logical
data model called METCE (see below).
For more information, see:
• ISO 19156:2011, Geographic information –
Observations and measurements
• OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic
information – Observations and measurements",Recommended
4.2.3.1,METCE,"The METCE component represents technology
that provides rules and a standardized approach
for modelling observations and simulations in the
weather, water and climate domains.
METCE is an application schema conforming to
ISO 19109:2005 Geographic information – Rules
for application schema. Furthermore, METCE is
a profile of the Observations and measurements
standard that provides domain- and applicationspecific
semantics for use within the weather,
water and climate domains.
The initial iteration of METCE and its companion
model, the Observable Property Model, were
developed by the Task Team on Aviation XML
to support the ICAO Meteorological Information
Exchange Model.
However, METCE will provide a common
semantic basis for a growing number of data
products relating to observation and simulation
within WMO. Not only will this simplify the
requirements for software systems working with
WMO products, it is also expected to simplify
the mappings between WMO data products and
counterparts from other communities such as CFnetCDF.
As at December 2013, plans have been made
to provide mappings/rules to convert from the
METCE application schema to BUFR sequences
and/or GRIB templates at some point in the future.
For more information, please see:
• AvXML-1.0 data model
• ISO 19109:2005, Geographic information –
Rules for application schema",Optional
4.2.3.2,Climate observations application schema,"This component represents technology that
provides rules and a standardized approach for
modelling climate observations data.
It is anticipated that METCE will be used as the
basis for developing an application schema
that will provide more detailed semantics
and constraints specific to a given domain or
application. In this way, METCE will provide the
basis for an application schema developed to
support the wide array of climate observation
applications.
The scope of such an application schema is
expected to cover both the climate observations
themselves and the associated observation
metadata (see subsection on observations
metadata (4.3.1)).",Optional
4.3.1.1,Station identifier,"This component supports the management of
identifiers associated with the observation station
or platform.
Identifiers include:
• A globally unique WMO identifier. The use
of this identifier must become a priority in
order to support future global analysis. See
recommendation 11.6 of this publication.
• Other identifiers or aliases used for the station.
• A history of past used identifiers, including
historical WMO identifiers.
• The beginning and end dates of each historical
identifier used for the station.",Required
4.3.1.2,Station overview,"This component covers what to provide in an
overview of the observation station or platform.
This should include:
• Station owner
– If required, the sensor owner

• Maintenance authority
– If required, the sensor maintenance authority
• Station licence agreement
– If required, the sensor licence agreement
• Station data usage constraints
– If required, the sensor data usage constraints
• Purpose of the station

relevant for stations that use manual
observation methods and where observations
are not taken on a continuous basis

observations data for a given station, sensor
and phenomenon combination, together with
the URL of the relevant discovery metadata
records
• Observers and maintenance personnel,
including their names, experience and training
level

electricity suppliers, communications suppliers,
etc.",Required
4.3.1.3,Station status,"This component supports recording the period(s)
of activity during which observations were being
made at the station or platform.
As it is possible for stations to close and then
reopen at a later time, the time period of each
status is also required.
Valid operational status codes are:
• Operational
• Not operational",Required
4.3.1.4,Station type,"This component supports recording the type of
station or observation platform.
Ideally, the type will be recorded for each
instrument used at that station.
At a minimum, the station type is to be recorded in
accordance with the following guidelines:
• Manual on Codes (WMO-No. 306), Volume I.1,
code 1860, and Volume I.2, code 0 02 001
In addition, there may be multiple definitions
of station types used by the NMHS and other
organizations.",Required
4.3.1.5,Location,"This component covers the recording of
details relating to the location of the station or
observation platform.
As discussed in the Sensor component below
(4.3.1.7), recording the location of each sensor at
the station is also mandatory.
The following information is required:
• Latitude
• Longitude
• Elevation
• Spatial reference system (horizontal and
vertical)
• Date/time of the survey observation used to
record the location of the station and/or sensor
• Temporal reference system
• Method used to determine the location of the
station
• Positional accuracy of location
• Date/time the station or sensor moved,
together with previous locations
• Administrative boundaries within which the
station is located (as required by the NMHS)
• Time zone
In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary
to move a station and keep the same station
identifier. This should only be done in accordance
with future global climate data policies and data
governance processes (see recommendation 11.1
of this publication). Typically, this will involve
parallel observations at the old and new station
over a period of time (two years, for example).
If this is necessary, the time of the move should be
recorded, together with current and past location
details.
The precision required for the latitude, longitude
and elevation should be in accordance with
guidance provided by the Commission for
Instruments and Methods of Observation.
While not authoritative, the final report of the
first session of the Commission for Instruments
and Methods of Observation Expert Team on
Standardization suggests that the precision
required for latitude and longitude measurements
is one second (of arc), which equates to
approximately 30 meters at the equator. This
degree of precision should be achievable using a
survey observation process that uses handheld
GPS techniques.
Administrative boundaries may refer to different
types of boundaries that contain the station,
including:
• Political boundaries, such as state, regional or
district boundaries
• Administrative boundaries, such as the forecast
district
• Natural boundaries, such as hydrological,
catchment or topographic areas
