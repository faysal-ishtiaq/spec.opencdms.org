8.1.1.1,Web Map Services,"This component represents technology suitable
for the distribution of a wide range of climate data
via a Web Map Service (WMS).
In essence, a WMS provides a map view of data
distributed via a georeferenced image.
For more information, see:
• OGC WMS documentation
• The OGC Meteorology and Oceanography
Domain Working Group paper on the use of
WMS with time-dependent and elevationdependent
data",Recommended
8.1.1.2,Web Feature Services,"This component represents technology suitable
for the distribution of a broad range of vector
climate data via a Web Feature Service (WFS).
In essence, a WFS could provide vector and
tabular climate data, which could be presented in
a number of formats such as GML (see OGC GML
web page) or Environmental Systems Research
Institute (ESRI) shapefile.
Some WFS implementations can serve data
constrained by a logical data model (also known
as an application schema). It may also be possible
to enable WFS server software to provide
meteorological observation data via WMO formats
such as BUFR.
There may be issues with serving time series
via WFS. There is discussion that a Sensor
Web Service may be better for time-series
observations.
For more information, see:
• OGC WFS documentation",Recommended
8.1.1.3,Web Coverage Services,"This component represents technology suitable
for the distribution of a wide range of gridded and
array climate data via a Web Coverage Service
(WCS).
In essence, a WCS provides the actual gridded or
array data.
Future versions of WCSs are intended to support
logical data models defined as application
schemas.
For more information, see:
• OGC WCS documentation",Recommended
8.1.1.4,Sensor Web Enablement Services,"This component represents a range of
technological tools suitable for the distribution of
a wide variety of observational data and related
metadata.
There are a number of services that will become
available when work stabilizes on these standards.
Sensor Web Services are typically used with
data that conform to the observations and
measurements data model. This model is well
suited to time-series data. Therefore, Sensor Web
Services may be an appropriate mechanism for
serving time-series climate data in the future.
For more information, see the OGC documentation
for:
• Observations and measurements
• Sensor Observation Services",Optional
8.1.1.5,CF-netCDF,"This component involves technology suitable
for the provision of a wide variety of gridded or
array scientific data written as netCDF files that
support the conventions for climate and forecast
metadata3.
For more information, see:
• Wikipedia article on netCDF
• OGC netCDF standards suite
• The OGC CF-netCDF core and extensions
primer

3 In this context, the term metadata refers to a set of fields in the header of a netCDF file that describe the context and
format of the array data contained in the CF-netCDF file.",Recommended
8.1.1.6,Geosynchronization,"This component concerns a series of technological
tools that enable a data publisher to distribute
a data product in an environment that supports
managed change to the source data.
In theory, end-users could subscribe to a data
source and have changes to the data replicated in
their copy of the data.
In summary, geosynchronization services are
expected to support several processes, including:
• Allowing interested parties to subscribe to an
authoritative data source.
• Data entry with validation.
• Notifying interested parties of changes.
• Allowing replication of the data provider’s
features.
It is anticipated that geosynchronization services
will support crowdsourced data and processes in
addition to authoritative data sources.
At present, geosynchronization services are being
developed with the current version of a standard
that only serves data via a WFS. It is expected
that geosynchronization will support additional
services in the future, including WCS and WMS.
For more information, see:
• OGC overview of geosynchronization services
• The OWS 7 engineering report on the test of
geosynchronization services",Optional
8.1.1.7,Web Processing Services,"This component covers a range of technological
instruments that provide a standards-based
framework for developing spatial processing
services that operate via an internal network or the
Internet.
This standard is being used by a number of
open-source projects and vendors to develop the
building blocks that will support a wide range of
spatial analytic processes.
The latest version of the standard is being
developed to support both synchronous and
asynchronous Web Processing Services (WPS).
This standard has considerable potential for future
CDMS use, for example:
• To enable an NMHS to establish a suite of
services to process and analyse climate data
within a services-oriented architecture.
• To enable a future service-provider to offer
CDMS-related services via “the cloud”.

8.1.1.8,Symbology Encoding,"This component represents a range of
technological tools that provide rules and a
standardized approach for defining alternative
visual portrayals of spatial data via an internal
network or the Internet.
Symbology Encoding, together with Styled
Layer Descriptors (SLDs), can be used with
WMSs, WFSs and WCSs to enable user-defined
symbolization of spatial data from within a
collection of published styles.
As an example, it is possible to publish several
colour classification schemes for a gridded
dataset, allowing end-users to select one that is
appropriate for their use.

8.1.2.1,Combined climate observations and metadata,"This component represents the technology,
software, processes and governance needed
to support the transmission, consumption and
processing of combined climate observations
and associated metadata via a future climate
observations application schema (or similar name)
derived from:
• The schema outlined in the Climate
observations application schema component
(4.2.3.2)
• The schema outlined in the METCE component
(4.2.3.1)
As discussed in the section above (8.1.2), this work
is currently embryonic. However, it is anticipated
that it will become a key technological mechanism
for exchanging climate observations and metadata
in future years in support of data interoperability
and platform independence.

component (4.2.3.2)",Optional
8.1.2.2,Taxonomies and registers of authoritative terms,"This component is related to the previous
component. It represents the technology,
software, processes and governance needed to
develop an authoritative definition of the concepts
and terms referenced in a logical data model
such as a future climate observations application
schema (or similar name), and to enable the
publication of such terms.
Following the work of the Task Team on Aviation
XML, WMO has established the WMO Codes
Registry, which provides a web-based publication
of terms from the Manual on Codes (WMO-No.
306).
The current coverage of terms is sparse – only
covering the aviation-related terms required by
the sponsoring activity – but there is commitment
from WMO to populate the remaining code tables.
The WMO Codes Registry provides a well-defined
programmatic application programming interface
(API) alongside the web application. Where the
need arises for publication of locally managed
terms, it is recommended that the registry API be
supported.
An open-source reference implementation of the
registry software is available.

2013b, 2013c)",Optional
8.2.1.1,Discovery metadata catalogue,"This component refers to the technology and
processes that create a discovery metadata
catalogue. This catalogue is used to publish
an organization’s data holdings as discovery
metadata records, with corresponding records
describing which online services may be used to
access each dataset.
A discovery metadata catalogue allows an
organization to participate within the WIS
environment.",Required
8.2.1.2,Observations metadata catalogue,"This component refers to the technology and
processes that create the observations metadata
catalogue used to publish an organization’s
observations metadata records.
It is anticipated that the climate database will be
used to store and manage observations metadata.
This component will serve as an IT catalogue
service for observations metadata.
More work is required to define this component.",Optional

8.2.2.1,Linked data,"This component supports semantic search
requests such as those used with linked data.
This is an emerging requirement that is building
considerable momentum within information
management communities.
The Australian Climate Observations Reference
Network – Surface Air Temperature (ACORN-SAT)
dataset, published by the Australian government
at http://lab.environment.data.gov.au/ provides
an example of how linked data may be used for
publishing climate data.
More work is required to define this component,
including its relationship to the approaches
adopted by WIS.

dataset (Lefort et al., 2013)",Optional
8.3.1.1,OPeNDAP,"This component represents technology suitable
for the distribution of a wide range of scientific
data via the Data Access Protocol (DAP).
DAP is used in the world’s scientific community to
allow Internet access to a range of scientific data.
The protocol does not support the concept of
spatial reference systems as defined in the OGC
Abstract Specification on spatial referencing by
coordinates. This makes it very difficult to reliably
integrate data hosted via DAP with other spatial
datasets, including those hosted via open spatial
services.
Therefore, it is considered more appropriate for
cases in which researchers and scientists only
want the data for numerical analysis.

• OPeNDAP Wikipedia page
• DAP 2.0 Specification",Optional
8.3.2.1,WMO formats,"This component represents technology suitable
for the distribution of a wide range of climate data
via traditional WMO formats.
